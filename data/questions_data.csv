1811,Tencent shares plummet after China proposes new online gaming rules,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18og23s/tencent_shares_plummet_after_china_proposes_new/,840,WickedSensitiveCrew,189,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/tencent-netease-shares-plummet-on-new-china-online-gaming-guidelines.html

Tencent lost about $43.5 billion in market value on Friday after China surprised financial markets with a fresh set of rules aimed at curbing excessive gaming and spending. The draft guidelines from China’s National Press and Publication Administration sank the Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent, NetEase and Bilibili — among the largest online gaming-related counters in the world’s biggest online gaming market. “The most recent regulatory move on the online gaming industry is the last thing the market was hoping to hear out of Beijing,” Brian Tycangco, an analyst at Stansberry Research told CNBC.   “While well intended, the move casts doubt on the viability of existing business models that mostly are built around incentive or rewards to attract users and boost loyalty,” he added. Shenzhen-based Tencent, which owns WeChat and generated over a fifth of its third-quarter revenue from domestic online gaming, saw its shares tumble about 12.4% to close at HK$274, its lowest closing level since end-November 2022.


“I’m confident we’ll get more clarity on these new rules in the coming days and weeks. But investors don’t want to wait around for the dust to settle. Better coordination between industry and regulators will benefit everyone in the future,” Tycangco said. New draft guidelines released by China’s top gaming regulator require owners of online games to abstain from providing or condoning high-value or expensive transactions in virtual entities whether by auction or speculative activity, among other things.

Daily login rewards will also be banned, while recharging limits must be imposed with pop-up warnings issued to users who display “irrational consumption behavior,” the National Press and Publication Administration said. “These new measures do not fundamentally alter the online gaming business model and operations,” Vigo Zhang, vice-president of Tencent Games, told CNBC. “They clarify the authorities’ support for the online gaming industry, providing instructive guidance encouraging the innovation of high quality games.”",Industry Question,"['Chairman Xi would like to thank all bag holders for their investments in the Chinese communist party.', 'Fivecent now', 'Another example alongside education platforms, Alibaba, Ant etc, of the answer to the question people pose about “Chinese equities are so cheap, why isn’t everyone buying them?”.', 'When people ask why Tencent and NetEase like to buy Western game studios and publishers just point them towards this news.', 'As a BABA investor, don’t invest in China.

My standout deal was a recent acquisition involving U.S. Steel Corp. and Japan’s Nippon Steel. Amid the Covid-19 downturn, I acquired shares of U.S. Steel Corp. at a mere $8.09. Just yesterday, I successfully sold them at $49.7, yielding an impressive 514% return in a little over three years. With dividends factored in, the total return exceeded 520%.

1. Fed was fighting an inflation war, not a business cycle, so our bet was inflation would be softer.  You'd avoid a hard landing, and then we've seen the FED kind of take its foot off the neck of monetary policy.
2. Economists were too bearish, and the technical picture turned positive very quickly.
3. People should study the Market's internal structure we've seen a huge turnaround in cyclical stocks, the banks are turning, the regional banks are turning up, small caps are leading, this is not the end of cycle Market Behavior.  This is early cycle expansion reaccelerating.
4. If it was a head fake, we'd see credit calling baloney, and we'd see spreads riding or high-yield falling, but what's happened is spreads have rallied high-yields rallied.  It's actually an improving liquidity rally, while investors took $240 billion out of stock this year.
5. I think it's going to show the FED is no longer fighting an inflation war but really shifting towards managing the business cycle huge change. I think interest rates could make a huge move lower. It could be 3 to 3.5%, and that would take mortgage rates down to 5 or under.
6. I do think that the $240 billion that left is coming back.

It isn't surprising that a lot of companies are choosing to debut their public listings on US exchanges even when the companies are registered outside the US. Until China cracked down on foreign IPOs, and apparently now Europe is thinking of doing so as well, from what I've come to understand Europe is extremely expensive from a brokerage and trading costs environment.

While it's great they have some good regulations that reduce US-style investing to a degree, I kind of sympathize with the idea that it's expensive as hell to list on an exchange in Europe when compared to listing in the US, normal Europeans do not want to invest in the stock markets for various reasons, and cost I think is absolutely one of those reasons.

In terms of discount European brokerages I found that many of them either do so with investing outside Europe or they resell the services of a US-based broker to actually offer competitive fees. Or if they actually do have a primarily Europe-oriented platform, the free/low fee part may be limited to a very small subset of investment products, or even if the % commission is reasonably low, the minimum fee may appear to be criminally high compared to a broker based in the US.

I feel like there's a lot of potential in Europe to encourage retail participation, but I feel like it is getting nowhere for now, especially with the comments coming from the European platforms when asked about this.

But I don't actually have the ground perspective of actual European investors, so I wanted to know what you guys think about the whole situation. I believe that if the costs of listing and investing in Europe were reduced, there could be massive increases in top line growth and substantial increases in bottom line growth, which would have a net beneficial effect on the earnings of the European exchanges.",Industry Question,"['UK is a bit funny with this. 0.5% tax on buying all UK shares but also have something called an ISA which lets you deposit up to 20k every year and ALL gains made are fully exempt from capital gains tax or UK dividend tax with no upper limit.

On the other hand, we have access to accumulated ETFs, which Americans, to my knowledge, don’t.\n\nIn my opinion, the reason people tend to invest much less in the stock market around here is mostly cultural.

I\'m not impressed with the SoFi app, as it\'s only marginally better than Charles Schwab (my favorite of the big bois), Chase and Citi.  \n\nHowever, the moat I see that SoFi has is 1) modern tech stack.

SoFi could easily eliminate this bonus offer and save themselves $156 a year ($3/week x 52 weeks).  As a faithful SoFi member, I benefit greatly from this but would still use SoFi Invest without this bonus.\n\n4) Watch Anthony Noto\'s speech or interviews, or look at his work history (former: managing director of Goldman Sachs, COO of Twitter, CFO of NFL, West Point mechanical engineering degree West Point, Army Ranger trained as a communications officer).

Noto consistently buys shares when it\'s < $7.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) For me, I look to invest in a company long term that has: a) large TAM (total addressable market), b) right product offerings that can scale to meet demand, c) right leadership team to make it happen.

The answer is always similar, and the process can be automated.I can create a website/questionnaire that asks you questions like:

* Your current financial situation
* Opinions on crypto and AI
* Causes you want to support, if any
* Predictions and opinions about the future
* Support for a presidential candidate, or a side in a conflict
* Hobbies and interests

This can be automated in the future with open banking, etc.

* S&P 500 - 80% (based on your risk profile calculated from your savings, salary, industry you work in)
*  Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and Teradyne, Inc. - 2% (based on the fact that you believe AI used in robots will revolutionise the economy)

And then you get taxed on the pre-tax portion of the distribution. \n\nExample:\n\nCurrent Traditional IRA = $100K pre-tax money and $0 post-tax money. \n\nWhich is 100% pre-tax, 0% post-tax. \n\nThen you put $7K of post-tax money in the Traditional IRA for the backdoor ROTH. \n\nNow your IRA is 93.5% pre-tax and 6.5% post-tax.\n\nThen you convert $7K from Traditional IRA -> ROTH.\n\nThe $7K conversion is considered $6545K pre-tax (93.5%) and $455 post-tax (6.5%).

Now you can do the backdoor ROTH. Because when you put $7K into the Traditional IRA, now the balance will be 0% pre-tax, 100% post-tax. So the conversion to ROTH will be 100% post-tax and you won't get taxed again.\n\nAlso the IRS considers all your IRAs as one IRA balance.

In a tax advantaged account, repositioning is free. There’s no reason to not move capital within a tax advantaged account quickly when your thesis changes.

Around mid last year, my grandfather died and my mother along with her 2 siblings has inherited his assets of around 20 hectares of land in the Philippines. Over my winter break, I learned about this and what they planned on doing with the land, which they explained they wanted to start a business with it as a quarry and contract soil to sell to companies that want it.( i literally dont even know what this means ) My parents think that the business will be super profitable and may give us the money to have my mother quit her job and live a comfortable life overseeing the business. Apparently this has been an ongoing process and my mother has already put in around 11k to assist with starting this up, but they explained that with the lawyer they are in contact with, they would need around 2.5m philippine pesos in order to transfer ownership of the land officially, pay the tax on the land, and whatever else needs to be done, and once those intial costs have been covered the quarry can start. 

The thing is, my parents want to start this process now and is urging me to give them the money (2.5m phil pesos = $50,000) to start this and that once the quarry starts, the first thing to be paid off is the money that's owed, which will be me plus even more money on top. My main concern is that I don't even have the money to give them BUT unlike my parents I CAN have the funds to give them. My credit is great unlike theirs and I've been looking up personal loans. Now before everyone freaks out, here is my money breakdown:

Monthly: $4200

Expenses: $1600

HYSA:17k

I have to say I am living comfortably at my parents house, once again saving money and whatnot which is why I'm so skeptical about all this. My plan is to put 15k of my HYSA and pull out a personal loan of 35k to fund this. Im confident I can make the monthly payments but it would absolutely smash my savings rate that I've been doing so well on.

It's really important to state that my family is not rich by any means and we do not have the money to fund this, I've already awknowledged this is an extremely risky thing but I must say, I live in an asian household so I absolutely love my parents and want the best for them. This post isn't some post saying my parents are nagging me for money. I love and trust them and want the best for them and am seriously considering this but i've awknowledged that pulling out this loan and having the quarry fail could basically ruin my life for the next couple years but haviing the quarry be successful would be absolutely great for jsut my family in general...and now this is the important part

My whole shpiel about this is that I have no idea what my money is going into. Ever since I've taken a minimalistic approach to life, the things I like to put my money towards has to have a reason that I myself am super familiar with. Typically I do countless hours of research about some investment method so that I know what I'm getting myself into, but in this situation I feel like I'm throwing my money at the void hoping itll make a lot of money with no way of doing any kind of research. So I know the general timeline of what they want to get done. But i don't know who the lawyer is, how my money will be broken down, how the business will work, man I dont even know what a quarry IS. So i'm hoping this post will give me some light into what I'm getting to. What exactly is a quarry and how does it work? What kind of costs are associated with starting a quarry in the Philippines? I'm imagining the money doesn't just go straight to my bank account when I get paid since this is a foreign business?  Does any profit thats given to us once it's started have to be taxed in the US AND PH? Is 20 hectares of a soil quarry over time really a profitable business? SHOULD I EVEN BE PUTTING MYSELF IN 35K DEBT TO FUND THIS given my situation??? I'm super skeptical if this will actually be a means to make a life-changing amount of money.

It makes no sense to me.

Looking at FRED charts, housing inventory is trending up from it's abnormal low and home sales have plummeted. Yeah, new home sales have been more steady, but that's only because we're in a rare moment where the median used and new home prices near identical. Considering affordability is at an all time low, used prices will eventually lower to create a more normal gap and take some of that market share back. I should note that new inventory is also trending up. So, we have an INCREASE in SUPPLY and a DECREASE in DEMAND... It's hard to interpret this any other way.

Next, looking at the projected EPS, it shows that it will be less than 2022 for at least the next 3 years. Only in the high, best case, scenario does EPS finally get back to 2022 levels, though it still takes 3 years. Also looking at projections, it's likely that there will be a 16% DECREASE in annual net income from the 2022 figure, this despite the fact that revenue will be almost even.

In conclusion, it seems most projections realize that the company will not achieve 2022 numbers, which were likely due to unique conditions that won't all be replicated (the lower interest rate, high house sale prices, decrease in building costs, etc.), so why is it that the stock is at an ATH and above 40% of what it was at the peak of 2022? Why is everyone so bullish? Are they counting on inflation to raise wages (affordability)? Unemployment is still officially low and that's done little for affordability (and it can really only go up from here in this high interest environment). Are people really predicting rates will go back down to the unprecedented 2-3%?

Any insight is appreciated!",Company Question,"[""I think the fault.of your argument is that you're using the previous stock price as an anchor. I think most investors realized that 2021 was not permanent and the companies were valued accordingly. Also, since you reference lennar, it's not 40% over it's previous peak. In late 2021 it peaked at $118. Now it's at $140. So not 40% over the previous peak. \n\nThe situation now with homebuilders is pretty unique. There's a shortage of housing, so their products are in demand. Existing homeowners are largely rate locked after refinancing during covid, so there is almost no existing inventory on the market. Homebuilders have a monopoly on the supply. Also, most homebuilders have the ability to pay points and lower their customers mortgage payments. The cost of this is a fraction of their profits, but really helps to move inventory."", ""That's the biggest thing, is the ability to do a mortgage buydown. So they not only have inventory, but they can offer better rates to people.\n\nThis article basically sums up what is happening with the new home builders:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/one-third-of-homes-for-sale-are-new-construction-7644618](https://www.investopedia.com/one-third-of-homes-for-sale-are-new-construction-7644618)\n\n>New homes now account for nearly twice as much of total inventory as they did pre-pandemic in the second quarter of 2019; the share of new homes increased to nearly 35% in the first quarter of 2022 from 16.7% in the 2019 second period. This jump in inventory can be attributed to three driving factors, according to a new report by Redfin.  \n>  \n>First is the surge in demand during the pandemic, fueled by remote work and record-low mortgage rates. Second is the shortage of existing homes in inventory due to homeowners feeling locked into their current low mortgage rates. Third is the leftover inventory builders face as high mortgage rates deter buyers.  \n>  \n>Newly built single-family homes for sale increased 4.5% year over year in June while existing homes dropped 18%."", 'I\'m going to challenge the ""decrease in demand"" belief.

Enter new homebuilders. Unlike existing stock, new homebuilders can offer significant incentives to reduce the cost of buying. Many are offering lower interest rates than the general market.

My wife has an ESPP for the first time.  Her first six-month purchase period concludes this Friday, 12/29, and then the shares will be automatically purchased that day (managed by Fidelity).  The company's stock price tends to bounce up and down a lot, but as of today, it is up 7% versus the beginning of the purchase period.  The shares will be purchased with a 15% discount on the share price at the beginning of the six months since that price is the lower of the beginning and end of the six months (unless there is a big drop this week, of course).  So we should make a nice profit beyond the 15% assuming there is no major drop.

There is no mandatory holding period for the shares purchased.  Because the stock price does bounce up and down pretty substantially from day-to-day, I would like to go ahead and sell on Friday if the price is up.  Is that even possible?  Would Fidelity process the stock purchase quickly enough for us to be able to go ahead and sell almost instantly on the same day?  Just asking in case anyone else has experience with an ESPP managed through Fidelity.

1864,Mortgage demand slips despite another drop in interest rates,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18mt7wa/mortgage_demand_slips_despite_another_drop_in/,18,creemeeseason,17,"Mortgage demand fell last week compared to the previous week, despite a continued drop in rates, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. 

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($726,200 or less) decreased to 6.83% from 7.07%, with points increasing to 0.60 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment, the group said Wednesday. Even with the recent decline, rates are still much higher than they were at the start of the Covid pandemic.

“With the positive news about the drop in inflation, and the FOMC projections proclaiming a pivot towards rate cuts, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate reached its lowest level since June 2023,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA senior vice president and chief economist.

“At least as of last week, borrowers’ response to this rate move was rather tepid,” Fratantoni added.

Applications to refinance a home loan dropped 2% for the week ending Friday, after jumping 19% the week before, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinance demand was 18% higher than the same week one year ago, however.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home declined 1% for the week and were 18% lower than the same period last year.

Despite the drop in demand, the Mortgage Bankers Association predicted good news ahead for the market, despite expecting “mild recession” in the first half of next year.  


“We expect that this path for monetary policy should support further declines in mortgage rates, just in time for the spring housing market,” the group said, referring to the Federal Reserve’s recent signal that it is looking to cut its benchmark rate multiple times next year. “We are forecasting modest growth in new and existing home sales in 2024, supporting growth in purchase originations.”

The association said it expects mortgage origination volume to increase 22% in 2024 to $2 trillion, with a 14% rise in purchase volume and a 56% jump in refinance demand.

Due to next week’s Christmas holiday, the MBA will release mortgage application data for the weeks ending Dec. 22 and 29 on Jan. 3.",Industry Question,"['Who cares about the w/w change.

There's a huge issue with the housing in the sense that homebuyers today are competing not against other wealthy buyers but the homeowners who have locked in LOW mortgage rates. No one with a 3% mortgage rate is giving up their home to buy an expensive home with a 7% rate unless they are making significant amounts of money and could afford the upgrade or they are bad with finances.""]","[14, 11, 10, 6, 5]",stocks

In Venezuela for instance, about 95% of Venezuelans use USTD for everyday transaction rather than bitcoin. many people mostly use Binance wallet and Binance p2p with USDT.

In Lebanon it is the same story, people who have Bitcoin are bitcoiners only. For normal day to day transactions they use USD cash and when in need to transact in crypto such as long distance transaction, they use USDT on the tron or polygon blockchain.

Argentina's currency has lost 13 zeroes in the past century or so, so the US Dollar is considered a safe haven by virtually everyone. That's why USD stablecoins are so popular.

In the Argentinean crypto fintech. USDT on tron is used everywhere. It’s the preferred token and network. People know how to use it and choose it cause it’s cheap.

It is clear that people experiencing inflation use USD stablecoins to move money. Tether on Tron/Polygon/Ethereum is very important to these people than BTC. To move money around in these countries, stablecoins coins are important.

People with failing local currencies want better access to dollars, and stablecoins provide that. For everyday transactions, people want something fairly stable like usdt and paper dollar and transactions to be cheap hence tron and polygon)

One of the reason USDT is popular in high-inflation countries is that it is one of the practical way to turn a rapidly declining currency into one with enough stability to make functional purchases.

Just opened a roth account and researching career opportunities to make more to funnel into stocks actually max out my roth annually right now I don't make enough which kinda socks.

Anyways my question can these companies grow their share prices when they already maximized their markets I mean how much more money can they make per year? I feel like it's a matter of holding on to key business to not lose to a competitor but as far as growth there is no more. So would that equate to the share prices hovering or slightly increasing? Like in the 90s apple had a small market with their desktops then in the early 2000s started ipods laptops then the iPhone there was so much of a market to expand upon and so much money to be made. Now everyone has an iPhone and MacBook its about keeping that consumer trend going. 

So if I want to make the most out of investments I need to find companies that are like apple in early 2000s. Or can I put money in these giant companies and still see a lot of growth?

The market maker pays the broker for this privilege, which typically allows the broker to operate without trade commissions. But the bid-ask spread basically acts like an indirect commission (albeit small) since the buyer is paying slightly more than the true price.

The information I haven't been able to find is:

* What is the effective average 'cost' of PFOF?
* Are ETFs included in PFOF and also have an effective cost to trade?

IB also has the most attractive cost of margin and is in my opinion the best retail brokerage out there.

Ie. how quickly and efficiently will the broker fill a marketable order. And what price improvements will be provided by the broker.\n\nFor long term retail investors who are simply buying and holding ETFs or highly liquid stocks a few times a month, it's inconsequential.

However, the presented pitch was that this fund is not attempting to beat the market on straight returns, but is instead aiming to provide maximum returns through a reduced tax strategy based on strategic buying and selling of stock. The fund data I have reviewed from fidelity shows a return about 1% higher than benchmark after management fees (the fee is .4%).

Stocks should offer at least the same yields as bonds, plus some premium for risk. So when bond yields decrease (and their price rises), that also pressures stock yields to decrease, resulting in an increase in price, and vice-versa (P/E can be considered as 'stock yields')\n\nHowever this relationship won't always hold. In the long run, stocks and bonds have had zero correlation, but in the post-GFC, QE-driven, 'bubble of everything' markets, stocks and bonds have generally moved together, and are still moving together for the time being.\n\nThe correlation will probably break if ever we hit a recession where people start to move out of stocks and into bonds, driving down the price of stocks and driving up the price of bonds. Or, it could go the other way if, for example, the fed were to become too soft again - in that case people would probably sell bonds and move into stocks, as the expected future risk-adjusted return would be greater on stocks. This is more like what you described. But really, there isn't any clear long term relationship between the two"", 'Money moves based on returns expectations. Stocks and bonds compete against each other. Gold/oil and commodities in a small way.

If yields increase usually that means people start to pivot out of stocks and into bonds because you can get a risk free rate that is higher than normal and without the risk of stocks. On the other hand, it just so happens that when yields have fallen, usually a recession coincides with that. This is because the fed is trying to rebound the economy by making spending (loans) less expensive due to contraction in the economy and bond yields decrease with the fed rate. When yields decrease, existing bonds with higher rates are worth more because you are receiving a higher rate than the market has currently. This is why many investors pivoted to bonds when rates hit their “peak” since cuts usually follow the peak, and bond prices increase.', ""> However this relationship won't always hold.

Whiskers had become a spectacle for the townsfolk, and in doing so, the essence of the town, their shared stories, and collective wisdom began to wither.\n\nRecognizing this grim change, the townsfolk watched as their unity and shared knowledge got overshadowed by the spectacle of the transformed Whiskers.

Quantitatively, I would need more tangible earnings to determine if they can provide a good ROIC.', 'Competition is only one factor.

It licenses its instruction set, which means it generates royalties from chip sales. However, there's only so much of a royalty it can collect. With RISC-V out there, if they push the licensing price up too much competitors will adopt RISC-V instead. \n\nSo basically I think they will be a big player, a profitable player, with lots of room for growth, but there is probably a limit on the amount of revenue they can ultimately generate."", 'But if they dont have any good competition, isnt that a likely road to a big success?', 'Kinda depends.

On paper, it's an amazing company. 100% Gross margin. 63% EBIT margin. 58.4% Net Margin (No debt).

Revenue CAGR over past 5 years: 47% (Not organic, multiple acquisitions but core product is ~30%)

EBIT Margin Expansion over past 5 years: 26.5 points

EPS CAGR 5 yrGrowth: 58.8%

No Debt. Massive dilution due to acquisition.

Foward P/E is roughly 21x. You could expect a 10 yr CAGR of ~20% organically. Margins continue to expand. Capex light as it creates games so the cost to add another customer is close to 0.

 Sounds like the perfect company right? What am I missing?

Off the top of my head, my main concerns other than poor future revenue growth/margin contraction are

 1) Shareholder value (or lack thereof). The company as aforementioned as no debt but acquires companies using shares. While this isn't technically ""terrible"", I'd prefer not to get diluted.

2) Sin stock- Gambling regulation could cripple the company. The market generally dislikes vices.

3)FX risk. The Swedish Krona has been weak and creates yet another risk for the stock.

They have some adapters that aren’t, they have some that are. I don’t know the cost for them to make all their chargers nacs, but I recall their now departed CEO stating something to the effect that it wasn’t a huge cost.\n\nMy view is, these companies have issues in terms of their balance sheet; and, the stocks are hated, and have been, ever since the NACs decision bc the entire market decided they were somehow obsolete, which I think isn’t fair.\n\nCHPT has a huge charging network, biggest in the world iirc.

And you would only really need to use their NACS if you can't find a Tesla supercharger which is going to be slimmer and slimmer as the years go by.\n\nThey're also very inefficient. Tesla manufacturers their own chargers. Chargepoint/Blink do not and simply installs them.\n\nThey're incapable of making a profit, not even close, and won't be for a long time. Where are they going to continue getting funding from? Lots of public companies operated for a long time as zombie companies that relied on low interest rates and easy capital funding to run their business.

So more lower quality chargers at terrible charging speeds with a high faulty rate doesn't excite me. Just means more costs and inefficiency, tbh.\n\nBoth companies have had their share prices completely plummet even before Tesla announced NACS deal with other EV automakers but the continue rapid decline since the announcements lead me to believe that the level of confidence people have in other EV charging companies outside of Tesla is very slim."", '[deleted]', 'I was in BLNK during the OTC days until listed.

1. Current ratio is low (about 1.1) - they will need to refinance at some time within the next year. Issuing debt is problematic due to interest rates and offering shares will dilute the price and cause short-term downward price action.
2. Revenue has been decreasing/staying flat for the past few quarters
3. Bookings have been decreasing/staying flat for the past few quarters
4. I didn't see any ""big releases"" that would drive substantially higher numbers related to points 2 and 3.
5. The company is very unprofitable
   1. Q2 loss was -$284M
   2. Net cash flow was -2.4B
6. P/S was highly inflated (at the time around 7-8): much higher than some of its comps
7. They are focusing their dollars on advertising, which hasn't been successful. Also, wtf does it mean to advertise to a platform where the audience are children will little financial autonomy?

Fast forward to Q3 earnings and the stock gets a huge bump (about 15%). Here are some of the numbers:

1. Current ratio about the same, slightly lower.
2. Revenue increase about 6%
3. Bookings increase about 7%
4. Q3 loss of -$279M
5. Net cash flow: -$2.4B
6. P/S: Over 10
7. Committed to providing guidance in future quarterly reports

So obviously these numbers are better than expected. I am obviously a bit butt-hurt, but I'd like to learn from my mistakes so I don't make them in the future. What is going on here? My confusion lies in the following:

1. P/S 7 is a lot. P/S of over 10 is even crazier.
2. The road to profitability hasn't been fully demonstrated and will take some time
3. How can a company with such a poor debt position be lauded by the markets?

I realize that shorter-term price action have much higher probability/variability. I am less concerned about the outcome and more about the thinking and what I can do in the future.  Is my thinking fine and my timing just bad? Can anyone help me out here?

I have $12,000 in a simple IRA from company B. (Vanguard)

I'd like to rollover company A 401k to company C (to have less accounts), and turn my simple IRA from company B to a Roth IRA and start contributing to this Roth as well.

This is a taxable event, so save away roughly $3k in cash to pay IRS in tax season. \n— you can always delay doing this if you don’t have the cash, but know that as your income goes up, this conversion will result in more tax (generally).']","[3, 3, 2, 1, 1]",investing

And they‘re now almost pricing in a 7th 0.25% rate cut by December – that would be one at every FOMC meeting from March to December.

There will be some rate cuts this year, as Powell already promised the markets, but I just don’t see 7 under a soft-landing scenario. Public comments from FOMC members also don’t indicate a willingness to cut that aggressively without a recession.

So what‘s the best risk-adjusted trade to make money in the event we get 3-4 cuts as expected (or something less than 7)? The FOMC dot plots predicted 0 cuts in 2023 & ended up sticking to it – the markets got it wrong.

1) Of course, I could \*sell\* federal funds futures directly (buying = betting on lower rates), but they tie up capital (about $3,000 in maintenance per contract), and losses can be devastating in another SVB scenario or negative jobs/GDP report.

2) I could also short sell short-term treasury ETFs or bet on options on those ETFs, but treasuries aren’t perfectly correlated with federal funds rates.

3) Polymarket had binary contracts (which is closest to the risk profile I’d prefer, rather than potential unlimited losses) last year on Federal Reserve policy, but nothing this year.

2194,What are the fundamental traits of promising companies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18a7y62/what_are_the_fundamental_traits_of_promising/,6,rifleman209,9,"I am looking to build a screener that looks at some universal truths of promising companies. Something that when higher/lower it is basically always good. In this post I will argue for the inclusion of some traits and the avoidance of some common ones. Please see below:

What makes a promising company?

*Sales, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Growth*: if you ain’t growing your dieing.

*High Gross Margins*: indication of significant value add

*Low Debt and Interest Coverage*: this is where risk of a company is. The lower the better, particularly if they are doing well in all the other factors.

*Low Shareholder Dilution*: like debt, if they are doing the other things well but give the company away, that’s no good.

Characteristics I’d argue against:

*Net Income margin, Operating Income Margin, ROE*: as you get farther down the income statement, more and more can be played with by management. Take AMZN for example. Look at this [chart](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-revenue-vs-profit-2016-1). AMZN had torrid growth and never grew earnings. Why did the stock go up even though it was and still kinda is a non-profit? They were reinvesting aggressively to fuel that growth ultimately growing their future cash flows more than they otherwise would have been if they showed a profit. Also by not having profits, you minimize taxes. AMZN isn’t the only one to do this, Salesforce did the same [thing](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/19/saupload_b70533bae99138dbebd44adae05789c8.png).

It’s not that I think NI, OI and ROE are bad, I am looking for promising companies that are before their maturity.

With ROE, that tells you where a company is, not where it’s going. Take Colgate, they have an ROE of 500%! Do we think that each incremental investment they make will yield a 500% ROE? of course not. They have been able to replace equity with debt to make the “E” smaller jacking up the ROE.

NI Margin is getting more manipulated with GAAP changes. For example, pass through gain and losses on security investments flow through the income statement. Berkshire is a classic case here.

OI Margin: As mentioned above, companies can purposefully spend more to boost growth and if you have say 60, 70, 80% gross margins, that seems like a great idea. This will mean no profits today, faster growth today, and hopefully a greater ability to harvest profits later.

*What do you think, are there any other universal truths of promising companies?*

Feel silly for asking, but would it be a better investment to reduce my 401k contribution from 15% per paycheck to 5% (for company match), and use the allocated funds to payoff current debt ?

Current Salary - $65k - (Avg 4-5% increase per year)

* Current Debt: 
   * $40k - student loans (3.5 - 6.5% Interest - $300 month payment)
   * $1.4K - personal loan (12% interest -$100/m)
   * $1.1K -  Financed Loan (8% interest -$100/m )
   * 320K - mortgage + utilities ($1800/m)

It seems trivial to utilize the allocated funds towards the mortgage at this time. Mostly looking at the Student loans and personal loans. Part of me feels like the reduction will not be worth it and should keep the investment going. I hate feeling like the ""bare min"" is ever going to get the student loans and such taken care of though. Also feel like 3months of ""emergency funds is not sufficient right now.

You lose the compounding (and tax advantages) of the 10 years you weren't contributing, and due to the caps, you may not be able to contribute as much as you would like in 10 years. \n\nThe tax advantage savings alone is worth more than the student loan interest rate. \n\nHowever, as you get raises in the future, you should probably dedicate at least some of that money to paying off the student loan debt (and some to increasing your retirement contributions).\n\nWith the exception of high interest debt, min-maxing doesn't really work for personal finance type things - you usually need to be contributing to retirement, emergency fund, paying down debt, and saving up for X...all at the same time."", ""It's free money as a part of his compensation.

All the major brokerage houses seem to think everyone should be in international, perhaps even at market cap weight (like 60/40!).

The US can and does have occasional ""lost decades"" of flat to negative returns.   \n\nOn the other hand, US and international are perhaps more correlated than ever before.   And it\'s hard to deny how much international as a whole has sucked compared to US-only over the last 15 years.   That said, I do recall an analysis that showed the US\'s recent outperformance was statistically VERY unlikely (so not worth counting on it going forward) - something like a 1-in-a-hundred sort of thing.\n\nBuffet and Bogle both seem to have a ""no on international"" attitude.

I\'d look up a Ben Felix video on international and see if you find those arguments persuasive.\n\nPersonally I aim for 15-20% of my equities to be international.

Everyone is so zoomed into the chart that they could see an ants ass. Zoom OUT and pay attention to the context that the market is laying out for you. \n\nZoomed in, you see a wedge bull flag. Problem is, if you zoom out and look to the left, you'll see the market has been in a trading range, and that flag is at the top of the trading range. The probability of that flag failing is higher than it succeeding in a breakout. \n\nHow about a wedge bear flag? Great short, right?? Zoom out, you're at the bottom of a bull channel. You think the probability of that bear flag working out is good? \n\nThis is why people say pattern analysis or TA is bullshit. They don't look at the context that those patterns are setting up in. \n\nWhen I trade, I am zoomed out far enough to see 3 days of price action.

If it’s an exact science, everyone would be a billionaire. Best way to verify is to learn and backtest it yourself.', 'Context my friend. \n\nSo I actually trade chart patterns, for reference I am a swing trader looking to hold trades for days/weeks/months if lucky! But the dirty secret is that not every chart pattern works as intended, but some do! So how is this better than random? Let me explain as there are a few steps before you actually get to a trade. \n\n1. Not every chart has a ""good"" chart pattern, so we rule these out first, this eliminates about 90% of stocks. \n2. The patterns that you do see need to be further vetted, are they structured correctly, are the in good names or are you looking at some random garbage stock. Does the stock fit your criteria, market cap, sector, theme, whatever. \n3. Out of the remaining candidates what is the longer term trend? What is the shorter term trend? What is this chart pattern and does it fit the story that the chart is telling? Can the market support the potential move that the chart implies? This can be hard as many people trade all the time and may not take this into account as much as successful traders. \n4. Putting a plan together to trade the chart, where is your stop, what is your profit plan? \n5. Trade. \n\nSo you can see its not as simple as ""Oh...this chart pattern...click mouse button...oh, me make money!"" (Do gorilla voice). \n\nTA really tells a story. The ""classical"" chart patterns (at least classical to my style of Oneil based trading) are accumulation patterns and show up during good markets. Charts can be random, but chart PATTERNS are not. \n\nI will finish by saying this. EVERY style of investing fails, but you make more when you are right then when you are wrong with money management rules. Buffet has had losses, its true! So if you want to compare Buffett buy and hold vs chart pattern trading on the 5 minute, they are the same in my book. The strategies are different but they each take risk! It is our job as traders to take risk. DUH. So don\'t listen to those that say ""this doesn\'t work"" or ""that doesn\'t work"". It all works if you have proper money management strategies.', ""In the financial market, patterns and trends are formed due to the collective actions of buyers and sellers, driven by their emotions and expectations.

1939,My maintenance capex calculation - does it make sense?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18khc4n/my_maintenance_capex_calculation_does_it_make/,4,NN110,12,"I have trouble in estimating company's maintenance capex. I don't want to substract actual capex from operating cash flow because it differs greatly from year to year and contains expenditures for growth (not just maintenance).

I came up with following solution to estimate maintenance capex:
1. I've calculated the rate of depreciation, amortization and impairments (DAI rate) from last 10 years in a following way: year's DAI / year's average total assets 
2. Then I've taken the lowest rate (to exclude everything that isn't normal depreciation and amortization - impairments, write-downs, etc.) and multiplied it by current's year average total assets. 
3. I've taken the figure I've calculated as proxy for maintenance capex.

Do you think this calculation makes sense? Or should I e.g. take average rate of DAI instead of lowest (that would certainly include one-time charges like impairments though)? Or maybe I shouldn't use depreciation & amortization as proxy for maintenance capex at all?",Company Question,"['CPA and former investment banker here\n\nI\'m gonna be blunt: this is an awful approach for calculating MCx. Reason being, you\'re trying to back into your ""steady state, recurring"" capex figure (which is purely a cash flow metric) by using DD&A (which is purely an accrual accounting metric, and largely functions to satisfy the Matching Principle). \n\nSame goes for impairment write-downs (which has nothing to do with capital budgeting or big capital expenditures, only a GAAP accounting convention)\n\nTo be honest, management ***usually*** discloses MCx guidance during Q4 earnings and they\'ll sometimes mention maintenance breakout from their entire capex figure during earnings calls Q&A (might get lucky finding something in an IP on their website, too).\n\nIf you find nothing and **still** feel compelled to find an approximate breakout of maintenance vs growth, you *can* use your PP&E deltas period over period, but you can ignore depreciation - you just want to focus on PP&E Additions (which accounts for capex on your SCF). \n\nWould caveat that I don\'t think there are SEC filing requirements that force publicly traded companies to disclose this quarterly (possibly at year end, but I\'m not 100% sure here). \n\n\nThat being said, you can back into this number by using the SCF, but you\'re going to have to manually adjust it to back into your quarterly capex figures (since SCF is always shown YTD, not QTD).\n\nI\'d probably look at historical PP&E additions over the last 20 quarters (or 5 years total, if that info isn\'t disclosed) to get an idea of what ***minimum*** capex / PP&E additions dollar figure recurs quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. This seems like a fairly straightforward way to get an idea on what your baseline MCx requirements are, but, again, this can all change depending on what PP&E is capitalized to the balance sheet, especially if the ticker in question has pretty diversified, capital intensive operations (e.g. ADM immediately comes to mind here). \n\nIf this happens to be the case, I\'d expect management to provide some more color here either during their formal ER calls or during Q&A - if anything, equity research analysts will probably ask so that they can update / bake this into their CF forecast models they use to provide target price forecasts and buy / sell / hold recs - but, again, no official requirements by the SEC to do so - it would be purely at managements discretion as to whether or not to put these figures out into the ether.', ""They don't always, and you can't call up the CEO and ask like you could in the 80's and 90's, but often on earnings calls analysts will pry about this and management usually gives some kind of reasonable hints, if they don't say outright.\n\nYou can also work backwards and look at what were the big expansionary Cap Ex items, and remove those from D&A. If a retailer builds a new distribution center somewhere, it's often in the local newspapers or promotional news articles. Companies love that kind of free press.\n\nOne of the companies I enjoy following is a discounter called Ollies, and in their 10-k each year is a blurb that tells approximately how much it costs them to open a new store, and how long they expect the investment to pay itself back. So that makes simple arithmetic. If they opened 46 stores and a store opening cost $1 mil in new store expenses, I can peel $46M off this years CapEx and put it in the expansion bucket."", 'just ask the company', ""I dont think using the lowest historical depreciation rate is a good proxy for estimating maintenance capex.\n\nFirstly because maintenance capex tends to increase as the effect of growth capex materializes. Secondly because even the lowest depreciation rate includes a component of depreciating growth capex from previous years.\n\nMy approach would differ based on the type of company but assuming it's a mature industrial company, the proper way to do it would be to first judge historical growth and see if growth capex actually materializes as cost efficiencies or revenue growth. If you cant actually identify the effects, I would just assume all capex is maintenance capex to be prudent in your valuation. After that, you can look at some comparable companies' maintenance capex ratios and go from there."", ""There's some problems with this (and all quantitative measurement).\n\n1) A lot of inflation happened the past few years, and at least a good portion of it looks to be permanent, rather than regressing. Depreciation costs will not be lower than they were 4-5-6 years ago into the future, particularly for tangible assets like buildings/vehicles/machinery.\n\n2) Often companies carry assets on the books at historical values - the *historical cost principle in GAAP*. There is a required test for impairment of assets, but not a required test for updating your valuation of long-held assets like buildings, properties, etc. should they have *appreciated* greatly in value.\n\nThis is one of my favorite misunderstandings, because it can lead to a company reporting book values that are far - FAR - below the true book value of the company.\n\n3) Give yourself _more_ margin of safety, not less. More margin of safety means two good things happen to you. If you're wrong, you stand to lose less money (sometimes no money). If you're right, you stand to gain more money. The opposite is true when you skimp on margin of safety.\n\n4) An intelligent investor engaged in active investing cannot remove qualitative thinking from the equation. Think about the business, look at the competition, new technology that could make the business obsolete, choke points or single customers which could put the company into trouble, management's incentives, etc.\n\nThis goes beyond the question of how to measure maintenance capex, but from your post it sounds as though you're trying to create a formula to remove thinking from the process. That's a dangerous path.\n\nDecent estimates with lots of margin of safety beat precise measurements when it comes to investing. Precision isn't possible in this field.""]","[3, 3, 2, 2, 2]",stocks

- 6 year contract
- Standard Segment
- S&P500 index
- 500% cap with a 20% downside buffer (if S&P500 is down 20% by the end of 6 years we can get back principle)
- “Zero explicit fees” meaning all admin+ costs are “built into the cap and buffer”. I take this to mean the cap is lower but no fees are charged..? 500% is more than enough. 

I’ve taken a look at the prospectus but it is a bit confusing… I can’t tell what happens to dividends. 

From what I can tell, they waive all fees besides some a 1.25% annual fee that is charged daily. Does that mean 1.25/365 per day or 1.25/260 per day (full year or working days)?

It seems like a really good idea which could increase passive returns but I’d like to hear from someone who has used it.

First people who don’t know what it is, it’s a website where you can trade your voting rights for stocks you hold to generate extra income from your shares. 

A problem I see is that the volume is very low, but it seems as if the company itself bids 10$ at every auction which could give high returns if you are the only one selling votes for a particular stock even if you don’t have a lot of shares but I haven’t used it yet so if anyone has used it I’d appreciate it if you could give some insight.",Company Question,"['I actually read about the Shareholder Vote Exchange concept yesterday on Matt Levine’s bloomberg column “Money Stuff” and made an account. Here is my experience and some observations. \n\n- making the account was very fast. I was only asked for my name and email address, and it was instantly approved. I was not asked to provide my brokerage information or SSN\n- I found emails for the meetings of Visa, Intuit, and some other stocks I own. \n- finding the emails were a pain. Btwn my partner and myself, we have accounts at M1, Vanguard, Schwab, and Robinnhood and Fidelity. \n- M1 emails came from proxypush.com\n- VG emails came from proxyvote.com\n- could not find any emails from Robinhood \n- Fidelity emails came from Fidelity.investments.email@shareholderdocs.fidelity.com\n- We get so many emails from these brokerages that these voting notifications are so easily missed\n- In every email from these brokerages, I copied the “control number” and pasted on the website. It took 20-30secs before a dialogue came back saying if it was verified. My $V and $INTU were verified but some others were either expired or restricted \n- I then listed those votes for sale in the auctions \n- I’m not super clear what happens next. My expectation is after the meeting, I will get paid whatever my vote sales for. \n- It’s unclear how this is taxed, although technically if I don’t make $600 then it’s not reportable. I guess if I make $600 extra from my portfolio from votes that’s a good problem to have\n- the website looks modern but it looks like it was designed 5 years ago. It doesn’t have the look of a crypto website \n- but it’s not well organized. I found myself backtracking and visiting the same pages multiple times. I guess maybe that’s expected because I’ve never tried something like this in the past\n\n\nOverall, the idea makes a lot of sense. For me personally, every time I get a email asking me to vote or something in the mail, it’s just noise. Like I mentioned earlier, we get so many prospectuses and random notifications from our brokerages that the emails asking me to vote are just garbage. I barely know who the CEO of these companies are. Who am I to vote yes or no for a director? And my vote is not going to make a difference. \n\n& on this point, I think that’s what makes trading shareholder proxy votes so interesting. In a political election, one person one vote (ok, yes, the electoral college system makes it so that people in swing states have much more voting power). But in a corporate election, a large shareholder inherently has more voting power. Why not let small shareholders make some money and leave it in the hands of those who care about a shareholder proposal or the such to decide? Maybe passive ETFs can enhance returns by doing the same.\n\nThough it’s surprising nobody has tried this in the past? Conceptually, trading shareholder votes feels like something Wall Street should have tried already? I question why this is getting started now and not 10 or 20 years ago. \n\nOverall, I am intrigued.

I don't know if these questions have been asked before. If it is, please let me know the link. I also understand for you guys 60k is not a big account (like my mentor account)

Background: 4 years total, paper for 2 years, small account for 1 year and this is my 4th year. Current account is around 60k (60% profit YTD)

My strategy includes a mixed of indicator, a combination of buying share scalping with 5x margin and LEAPS options but will take immediate profit if found. (So I do miss out on big gains, but my mentor said I should compare my profit to S & P and stick with current strategy)

Questions: As my account grow bigger, I am getting uncomfortable with scaling a bigger size. As in, I use the same strategy as smaller account, but always take the same amount of profit (for example, I always take profit when a trade reach 1000$ profit). In the long run, the profit percentage does not justify the account size.

Mentor-suggestion: My mentor knew my comfort zone is around 50k trading so he suggest me to put 80% profit in S & P 500 or VOO and add 20% profit to my trading pool until I can mentally handle more money

I trust my mentor but finding extra money lying around make me feel impatient (such as 10% S&P return compare to 50%  \~ 60% profit per year). **Can anyone give me some pointer how to scale/manage big size porf same as small size porf.**

In addition, I only trade few selected stock ( SPY, FAANG ), scalping if using margin and LEAPS if swinging. Also I am 23 so my mentor is worrying that Im not mentally prepare for big money, he did have some plan to make me get used to it, but I want to take initiative asking reddit first

Thanks !

I tried posting this in the r/options subreddit and it didn't even get posted, it was removed instantly after I clicked post. Not exactly sure why, but I feel confident that this can be answered here all the same. As stated in the post below. I am not concerned about the actual trade itself, and it being options isn't that big of a deal, because the same question and concern applies to all trading, such as stocks as well. Thanks to everyone.

Hello all,

I am hoping that some from the community can help me to better understand something I was wondering about earlier in the week.

So I ended up buying Call Options on a stock I felt would have good upside after their scheduled earnings call coming up next week. Let me mention, I'm not really concerned with discussing the actual trade itself, or if it was a ""good"" or ""bad"" setup, I feel comfortable with the DD I did and feel confident in my decision. As I'm still relatively new to Options trading (and I guess trading in general), I noticed that the earnings call was scheduled for 4:30pm, which would be after the markets officially close for the day. Now, as I've seen before, with other earnings call dates for stocks, after-hours as well, the stock moves dramatically sometimes, but it's after-hours......how is it possible for retail traders to take advantage of and / how does that even work? My concern now is that all my DD ends being correct, after-hours the stock soars up 500% (just kidding, but making a point), which would be good profits for me, but I'm screwed because I can't trade after-hours....and then by the time things settle the next morning, there's a massive sell off (obviously could go either way, this is just an example) and then I try to stop the bleeding as quickly as possible and take a loss. How are traders supposed to / expected to make moves around earnings calls that are outside of regular trading hours? Is there something I am missing or not understanding?

Four years back, I got ""lured"" into doing some insurance(?) at MetLife where I invest 400$ a month and they manage this, some kind of investment, not entirely sure of the details as I don't have the policy right in front of me.

I have had regular yearly meetings with representatives discussing details, perforamnce, etc.

Last year, when they showed me the performance it was like -10% or so.

Now, after started investing there it sparked my interest so I did some reading and created a portfolio of my own (not huge, but of about 50k$) and managed to get a return of 114.7% to date (i.e. roughly 2 years). I have mostly been doing swing trading in the TechStock market as I work in the field of IT.

That being said, understanding more or less how the markets work, it seems that investing in an ETF myself would be way better than MetLife handling any of my money (not only do they manage to underpofrm against the market, but also take some fee).

The money I put there are solely for my kids so I don't really want to do any kind of trading with them as I have a long period span of 18+ years to invest and wait.

  
**TLDR**: Started inveting in MetLife, they seem to underpform disasterously and I think to start investing into an ETF myself as I have gained some experience the past few years.

**The Question:** I want to start investing these 400$ a month ( as I curently have the option to opt out of investing in MetLife without any fee) as well as money coming from relatives for birthdays, Christmas, etc. (we get the kids enough presents anyway and I think we are doing rather well with income for Europe) into S&P500.

For those that aren't aware, SPIVA (S&P Indices Versus Active) was created by the S&P Dow Jones Indices in 2002.  This is essentially a longitudinal research study which compares data between active versus passively managed funds as there has been a long debate over which is superior.  This is a link to the website if you are interested in learning more: [https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/research-insights/spiva/s](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/research-insights/spiva/s)   

&#x200B;

The report shows that over a 15 year time frame 92.19% of actively managed funds underperformed the S&P500.  There is a separate report which shows when you account for taxes associated with active funds (due to high portfolio turnover) this number jumps to 97.7% of active mutual funds which underperformed.  This does however show that 2.3% of actively managed mutual funds did beat the benchmark over this time frame.

So my question is are you aware of which actively managed mutual funds beat the SPIVA over a 15-20 year time frame?  I am curious if these funds are even open to average retail investors or are these funds reserved for the ultra wealthy.

&#x200B;

Thanks

1399,Understanding Initial Margin Discrepancy in Leverage Trading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/177xub0/understanding_initial_margin_discrepancy_in/,3,Niko_l02,1,"Hello fellow traders,

I've been experimenting with leverage trading on both ByBit and KuCoin, and I came across an interesting observation that I'd like some insights on. I'm a bit puzzled by the initial margin calculations when using high leverage. Let me explain with two scenarios:

Scenario 1:

I went long with 0.037 BTC (valued at $995.02) with 1x leverage. In this case, my potential profit could be $151, and the initial margin displayed is $995.02, which makes sense.

Scenario 2:

However, when I use 100x leverage on the same 0.037 BTC, the initial margin is only $9.95. This is where my confusion sets in. Logically, I know that if I go with 100x leverage on $995, I should be playing with $99,500, and my margin should be $995. So, it seems like I could potentially lose more than $9.95 if the price moves against me, right?

...knowing that 529 plans will allow people to rollover $35k from 529 into a rothIRA starting in 2024, I had an idea...

does this mean, I even lose/forfeit the opportunity to add these losses to the cost basis of my new investment? or does this carry forward somehow until I vest or purchase the same/similar stocks at a future date? (I literally sold all of em)

*Reporting a Wash Sale Loss*

*The good news is that any loss realized on a wash sale is not entirely lost.* ***Instead, the loss can be applied to the cost basis of the most recently purchased substantially identical security***\*. Not only does this addition increase the cost basis of the purchased securities, but it also reduces the size of any future taxable gains as a result.\*

*Thus, the investor still receives credit for those losses, but at a later time. Also, the holding period of the wash sale securities is added to the holding period of the repurchased securities, which increases an investor’s odds of qualifying for the 15% favorable tax rate on long-term capital gains.*",Company Question,"[""Your vested RSUs would have had their cost basis adjusted due to the wash sale.

The idea with fixed income is obviously to get steady interest income over time. With funds however, how does it work when those corporations pay their periodic interest:
a) does the fund distribute those as dividend or does it remain as cash on funds balance sheet effectively increasing the NAV?
b) how do the funds reinvest those coupons - do they automatically buy more of the same underlying security for the fund?
c) does it really matter what the returns from a NAV perspective are at any point in time? ultimately shouldnt investors focus on YTM as their return benchmark?
d) why would returns significantly underperform YTM - i understand things may not be held until maturity but isnt the idea to get high coupon payments over life of fund? 
e) lets say interest rates drop this year, assume most high yield will appreciate in price - but as pointed out in c) should this matter much? 

Thanks",Company Question,"["">a) does the fund distribute those as dividend or does it remain as cash on funds balance sheet effectively increasing the NAV?  \n\nDistribute - in the US they generally have to distribute income for tax reasons. Up until the distribution date it may remain as cash or be reinvested and will be reflected in NAV. In some other countries they may be structured as accumulating funds.  \n\n>b) how do the funds reinvest those coupons - do they automatically buy more of the same underlying security for the fund?  \n\nHowever the manager decides is best  \n\n>c) does it really matter what the returns from a NAV perspective are at any point in time?  \n\nYeah, most people care about returns. If it's a CEF you would also care about return on market price.  \n\n>ultimately shouldnt investors focus on YTM as their return benchmark?  \n\nYield to maturity is a useful metric as part of understanding credit risk and projecting future expected returns. It is not itself return.  \n\n>d) why would returns significantly underperform YTM  \n\nIf yields rise, bonds fall in present value. If the bonds get downgraded, they fall in value. If risk aversion rises, credit premiums rise, and the bonds fall in value. If companies go bankrupt and default on the bonds, the bonds will be impaired and may pay out only a fraction of face value. If the fund trades poorly, it may lose performance. The fund also charges expenses which eat into returns relative to the YTM of its holdings. If it's a CEF, particular investor supply and demand for that fund also affect discount/premium to NAV and returns.  \n\n>e) lets say interest rates drop this year, assume most high yield will appreciate in price - but as pointed out in c) should this matter much?  \n\nShort term yes, returns would be high.

Im going to keep studying this but I wanted to try and get a quick answer. And if the NAS100 moves from 13,000.01 to 13,000.02 thats a 1 pip change correct?

Edit #1: I just saw that in Forex the pip change value depends on the lot size youre trading, so if you're trading EUR/USD, with a standard lot of 100,000 units. a 1 pip change could equal a $10. And a mini lot of 10,000 units could equal $1 for each pip change.

Can someone please explain how it works with the NAS100 and how the pips work there.

With Forex its the last decimal, so EUR/USD w/ 1.0003 exchange rate, the 3 is one pip. 1.0004 would be a 1 pip change up. But some pairs are quoted with say only 2 decimal places like Yen pairs. and .01 would be 1 pip.

 Edit #2: So for anyone who reads this wondering. NQ is the NASDAQ. A tick is .25  in movement. So 15000.25 to 15000.50 is a tick move. 4 ticks make up a  point. So 15000 to 15001 is a one point move. I believe MNQ may be like a  nasdaq mini?

By ""exactly"", I mean country/exchange/ticker information or even the ISIN of the underlying.

For example, I happen to know that RBGPF is the F share of the London Stock Exchange listing of Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc. (LSE symbol: RB, ISIN: GB00B24CGK77), but that is only because there is lots of information about this company around the internet. If I am looking at the F share of a thinly-traded and obscure security, it may be difficult to conclusively determine what the underlying security is, especially when the issuer also has multiple share classes, preferred stock issues, exchange-traded warrants, or rights issues. Previously, I used FINRA's [OTC Daily List](https://money.stackexchange.com/q/137969) to find the underlying securities, but not all F shares are on the list (probably because some of those F shares were created decades ago).

In other words, is there a central regulatory authority that registers F shares? If so, are the registration documents publicly available? If so, where can I obtain those documents? Note that I am not looking for third-party websites or resources. I am looking for the official source of information.",Company Question,[],[],stocks

Your withdrawals would be taxed at the lower progressive brackets as you fill each up while your income is low (nothing else) in retirement.', ""Will your pension put you in the same tax bracket you are in now?  If yes, the Roth will always turn out better.\n\nThe reason a traditional 401k/403b/457b/IRA is better for most people is that most people don't have defined benefit pensions.  They will be living off just the withdrawals from those defined contribution funds.  And even if their total withdrawals put them in the same bracket they were in before, they are still paying a lower *effective tax rate*, due to the standard deduction and all the lower brackets.  Deferring the taxes you would pay at your marginal rate, in exchange for paying at a later effective rate is where they make out.\n\nBut if you have a traditional defined benefit pension (as most people eligible for a 457b have) that changes everything.  The pension will fill up those lower tax buckets, as well as the standard deduction, and all your withdrawals will be added on top of the pension.\n\nSo if your pension puts you in the same bracket you were in while working, you are deferring the tax at that money at the marginal rate, only to pay the same marginal rate later on that income and all the growth it had in the meantime.  Why would you do that when you could just pay the marginal tax on the income now and have the growth be tax free?\n\nEven if your pension doesn't put you in the same bracket that you're in now, it will still eat up most of the lower brackets.

So you are investing more money in the market than with a Roth contribution.\n\nThe math on this is very simple: with the same **gross** amount invested, the difference is your tax rate when you contribute vs. your tax rate when you withdraw. If the two tax rates are identical, you end up with the same amount saved."", ""It is not a good calculator, specifically the part about investing the tax savings. When you compare equal dollars contributed, Roth of course looks better because it won't be taxed.

If you don't invest the tax savings, you are effectively saving less, so you will of course end up with less."", 'The calculator is ignoring the fact that contributing to a pre-tax (trad) account costs you less out of pocket thus you could invest more with same out of pocket cost as a Roth 457.

Synopsys recently dropped 8% to $520 and thereby broke its $525 horizontal support line and is now approaching its 50MA on daily candles.

Synopsys is one (if not THE) go-to software within Integrated Circuit (IC) design. ROIC of around 15%, ROE of >20%. Its revenue, Net Income and Free Cash Flow (FCF) have been nicely increasing over the years.

All in all, I see Synopsys as an attractive stock to hold for the long run given that ICs aren't going anywhere in the future. Growth estimates for the coming 5 years are at proudly 18% according to Finviz.

I'm looking for some advice here. The back story is the company I work for terminated their 401K program a few years back due to lack of participation. To receive the ""company match"" we had to open individual IRA accounts that we manage on our own. Essentially, every pay period money is deposited into my account, but the money is taxed. So, when I was filing my taxes last year, I put the information about my IRA in and a warning came up saying that my wife and I's AGI exceeded the max to have any kind of tax benefit for my IRA contribution.

For the record, my wife and I file married/jointly. Our AGI exceeds the $228,000. From what I am reading, we cannot participate in any kind of IRA program (Trad or Roth) due to this. But our company CFO is telling me that since this is the program that our company offers, I should be able to claim my contributions on my taxes. I've also read about back door IRA's, but I don't want to pay taxes on the money twice, since the money is taxed on my paychecks first.

Can someone offer any kind of clarity? Thank you in advance.",Advice Request,"['Being able to contribute to a Traditional IRA, and being able to claim those contributions as tax deductible, are two different things.  There is no income limitation on being able to contribute to a Traditional IRA.  The warning you received was about tax deductions.', 'There is no income limit for contributing to a tIRA.  There is only a limit for being able to deduct the contribution from your taxes.  If you\'re above that limit you can still make non-deductible (after tax) contributions, and in that case your non-deductible contributions are tracked as your basis.  Your capital gains and dividends are still tax deferred.  Later your withdrawals will be prorated with your basis.  So if you made $20k in contributions and $10k in earnings, 1/3 of your withdrawals would be taxable.  That way you are not double-taxed.\n\nThe limit for Roth IRAs will stop you from being able to contribute.  But there is no limit that prevents you from doing conversions.  This is the loophole that creates the ""back door"" for funding a Roth IRA.  You put your contributions in the tIRA (which would be non-deductible at your income), and then immediately roll those contributions over to a Roth IRA.  There is no double-taxation because you are only taxed on your income once.  When you withdraw later on, none of your withdrawals would be taxable.  Even if you were to withdraw the money early, before it was *seasoned*, you would only be taxed on the gains.  Not on your contributions/conversions.\n\nThe only issue with back door Roth IRAs is that the IRS treats all tIRAs you own as the same, and applies the pro-rata rule at conversion time.  So if you already have tax deferred money in a tIRA they will prorate any conversion you do against that amount.  \n\nSo if you already have $7k of tax deferred money in a tIRA and decide to use the backdoor to put $7k in a Roth IRA for 2024, the IRS will consider your $7k conversion to be 50% taxable, and half of your after tax contribution will be left in the tIRA.  But that would be easy for most people to deal with, as they could just contribute their $7k and then convert the entire $14k balance to the Roth.

If my employer offers both 401K (traditional and Roth) and 457B, what would be good investment vehicle for retirement?

Would you say max out 401K (traditional and Roth 50/50 split) and then whatever extra I can afford put that into 457B?  Or would you say instead of 457B invest into a post tax brokerage account, where I'm getting taxed on capital gains (more than likely long-term capital gains).

With 457B while it's tax deferred, all the distributions will be taxed as ordinary income, so I'm not paying taxes now, but paying taxes when I retire as ordinary income.

I have a financial advisor that before the end of year in December looks to harvest capital losses in my other investments in order to offset realized gains that my mutual funds pass along to investors during the year. The part I don’t like is I’m selling investments at a loss and can’t repurchase them for 30 days based on the wash sale rules and by then the price could be up or down. He explained that the basis of the fund is adjusted to reflect the realized gains which I understand but really doesn’t do me any good until I sell that fund sometime in the future So how do I really square that in my head, is it just the benefit of being in a mutual fund with professional management and it’s an expense (capital gains tax) that I have to consider at the end of the year, every year

More simply, how do you “sell” these details to someone looking to buy mutual funds?  Maybe that is the answer is just harvest losses to offset gains but that’s something I’ve never done as part of a methodology.

2031,Can Tesla stock reach $500 in 2024?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18hexgo/can_tesla_stock_reach_500_in_2024/,0,Playful-Ad6687,114,"Tesla has a remarkable history of delivering strong returns, boasting a trailing 10-year return of 2,560%. Even this year, with a 98% increase in share value, Tesla has outperformed the broader market. Despite currently trading 41% below its peak price of $410, set in November 2021, some optimistic investors are eyeing a target of $500 per share, implying a potential 100% gain.  
  
For Tesla to reach this ambitious goal by the end of 2024, several factors need to come into play. Firstly, the company must demonstrate fundamental improvements, particularly in revenue growth and profitability. However, recent challenges, such as a slower revenue increase of 9% in Q3 2023 and a decline in operating margin to 7.6%, indicate a need for substantial progress in these areas.  
  
Elon Musk attributes the challenges to an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, including higher interest rates affecting car affordability. Additionally, competition and ongoing price cuts have impacted Tesla's profitability.  
  
While revenue and earnings growth are crucial, the missing piece of the puzzle is the valuation. Tesla's current steep price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 78 poses a challenge. The stock's 98% increase this year is attributed to a 105% rise in the P/E multiple, indicating heightened investor enthusiasm.  
  
However, relying on continuous P/E expansion might be unrealistic, especially with already sky-high expectations and an uncertain market influenced by higher interest rates and inflation. To reach $500 per share, Tesla would likely need to deliver exceptional financial results, including a doubling of earnings per share between 2023 and 2024. Given recent trends like revenue slowdown and margin compression, achieving this bullish scenario appears challenging, prompting a cautious approach for investors with tempered expectations for Tesla's future performance.

So why not holding it for the long run?",Company Question,"['Because they can go down 3x as fast as the market.', 'There is a lot of misunderstanding of LETFs. Here\'s a comprehensive rundown and it\'s up to you whether you think it\'s worth it.\n\n1. LETFs track the daily % movement of the underlying index. Like the underlying index, it is affected by compounding when it goes up, and no compounding when it goes down, you can\'t lose more than you put in. In that sense, LETFs are different than other forms of leverage, there is no risk of a margin call or losing more than you borrow.\n\n2. Mathematically, the higher % you lose the higher % you need to get back to the same level. In a non-leveraged index, this is not really a concern, but if you leverage the underlying daily moves, the higher magnitude of the downside movement results in an even higher % needed to get back to the same level.\n\n3. Because of (2), the absolute magnitude of the daily movement matters in LETFs. The smaller the daily movement, the less the problem of (2) is a concern. If the underlying index only moves by small percentages, the less this is a concern because the difference between the downside and upside % is smaller. You could call this ""volatility decay"" because how much a leveraged daily move requires a higher % to get back to the same level is a direct function of volatility.\n\n4. Because of (2), (3), leveraged ETFs are not only a function of the underlying index, they are also a function of its volatility. By holding a LETF, you are also short volatility, you benefit if volatility falls, and you underperform when volatility increases. The concerns of LETFs not being a long term hold depends on expectations of volatility. For example, concerns about the underlying index moving -10% in 1 day and LETFs thus underperforming way overstates the actual volatility experienced by the index. If during a long period, the index moves 0-2% per day, there is in actuality very little ""volatility decay."" There is much more ""volatility decay"" if the index moves double digit percentages.\n\n5. Since the underlying index usually compounds over time, leveraging the daily moves also increases the compounding rate. That means if an index slowly increases by a % every day over some period, a leveraged ETF will actually outperform the target multiple of the index because the leveraged moves of previous days are also compounded. LETFs outperform when the index slowly increases over time.\n\n6. Expense ratios and interest rates: Although LETFs have higher expense ratios, they are not much higher, usually around 1%/yr. This is overshadowed by the yearly performance of the index and not a huge problem. However, LETFs also have to borrow money, this is usually done with swaps and varies by the issuer, however you should expect a (multiple-1) times the short term rate, so at current rates, UPRO (3x S&P500) is paying ~11% to obtain 3x leverage. The best time was when interest rates were close to 0, it cost very little for LETFs to borrow.\n\n7. Some strategies for the long term, since we established that by holding LETFs you are also short volatility, the best time would be to get in when an index falls quickly over a short period of time, you benefit from future compounding, the event that caused high volatility has also likely passed, and volatility usually returns to the mean over the long run. It\'s better to buy LETFs of an index that has low expected volatility, LETFs on commodities and specific sectors experience much higher levels of ""volatility decay"" simply because volatility expectations for these indices are always high.\n\n8. **TLDR**: There are 3 major forces that makes LETFs outperform or underperform. 1) Index compounding 2) Index volatility 3) Interest rates. Since we know a stock index usually goes up over time, LETFs magnify this through leveraged compounding, however increases in daily volatility will result in underperformance and borrow rates can be difficult to overcome during periods of high interest rates. Whether holding LETFs long term is worth it isn\'t ""never"" or based on selection bias, it\'s your personal risk/reward regarding these 3 functions. LETFs are extremely high risk, there is much lower visibility because future volatility is not really predictable, however some of the concerns against them, such as examples with double digit daily moves, are not based in reality, and underestimates the potential outperformance you can get of LETFs.', ""Someone asks this once every week or two.

31,How could fundamental analysis based investing ever work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/196g9xn/how_could_fundamental_analysis_based_investing/,0,Greenbargo,30,"From my understanding, the idea behind fundamental analysis investing is that there is a way to determine the *real* value of a stock and then compare that to the current market price of the stock. If the stock's *real* value (as determined by varying criteria such as quarterly earnings or P/E and the like) is lower than its current price then we know we should buy the stock and then sell it when that *real* value matches or exceeds the current market price.

If my understanding is correct, I don't see how this strategy could ever work. Here's why:

**Option 1:** All investors use the same criteria to determine *real* value. If everyone is using the same criteria as you are then they will see that the stock is undervalued just like you would see and so they would invest (likely before you get a chance to) and bring the current price up to its *real* price. This would mean that all stocks are constantly accurately valued and that all *real* prices match current prices. Thus fundamental analysis would provide no benefit to an investor.

**Option 2:** All investors use different criteria to determine *real* value. If everyone uses different criteria to determine *real* value of a stock then you might know that a stock is undervalued before almost anybody else since you selected the *correct* criteria while others used *incorrect* criteria. The issue is that even if you know that a stock is undervalued by your own criteria, if nobody else knows this (since they used other criteria from you) then the stock's price will not increase. If the price doesn't increase it will remain at its current price even though you know that it's *real* price is higher. Thus in this case as well, fundamental analysis would provide no benefit to an investor.

**Potential but problematic answer**: The only way fundamental analysis could benefit an investor that I can think of, is if people use different criteria (option 2) and some use objectively correct criteria for determining the *real* price of a stock. If only some investors are using the *correct* methods and others buy the stock for no reason (or at least not based on *correct* fundamental analysis that somehow still led them to buy the same stock but later than the original investors) then the stock price would rise and the original investors would benefit. But if there are objective criteria for predicting stocks, how have they not been fully discovered and adopted by all major investors? That is, if there is a way to 'see through the matrix' and evaluate stocks in a consistently successful manner that is nonobvious to other investors, it would certainly become the most common way to evaluate a stock, thereby rendering it fully ineffective. For this problematic answer to be true there would need to be a *correct* list of criteria relevant for evaluating stocks that is either kept highly secret or that is known but that is ignored by most investors. Both these seem highly unlikely to me.

Any answer to this puzzle that is better than my problematic answer would be greatly appreciated. Any direction towards research or articles that answer this question would be great too. Thanks.",Company Question,"['The idea is that, if you do the right analysis, you will find companies that are valued at a low price and time will tell if you are right.

Some time in the next five years the company will start to make bigger profits and make more money and the stock will go up.\n\nFundamental analysis is generally trying to anticipate future revenues/benefits, not current ones.

Once you have maxed out your Roths, I’d start investing (using your same fidelity account) to open a taxable brokerage account.

For context, I am just under 30 years old, annual income around $80,000, and no debt/loans/substantial monthly payments.

The state offers a healthy pension that will give a great monthly income into retirement, but I like to prepare as if that pension (as well as social security) won't be there when I retire in 30+ years.

I have both a 403b (current balance is around $15K) and a Roth IRA (current balance of $80,000). Additionally, I've got a single account with $140,000, plus miscellaneous savings/checking accounts. 

I've been maxing out my Roth IRA since I was 19, and I picked up the 403b when I started my job, just putting a hundred bucks or so into it each month.

My question: should I be shifting more money into my 403b vs. the Roth IRA?

My motivation of asking this is that as an individual who wants to stock pick, the hedge fund metrics are not very useful (e.g. they may be restricted by market cap, day trading, using options and other complicated tools, etc). If I for example knew that even for the honest effort individuals, the success rate is less than 10%, would give me a bigger peace of mind to just diversify in SP500 etc and let go stock picking.

This has done me really well over the years, but I've had recent doubts after chatting to a (supposedly) finance-savvy friend of mine. He advised me that although my money was in an index fund, and therefore automatically diversified amongst sectors, that my geographical diversification was poor and I should consider investing in something like VEUR to get some exposure to european markets. 

Is this good advice? I'm a little skeptical, since this would mean investing in a new index fund rather than just pumping more money into the, historically lucrative, S&P500. Is this a good idea? If so, what would be the ideal split of my portfolio between these two funds?",Industry Question,"['You\'ll hear lots of different opinions regarding international diversification. John Bogle himself was fairly clear up until about 20 years ago that it wasn\'t necessary, but then he softened and said that a 10-20% allocation wasn\'t necessarily a bad thing. When you buy the stock of foreign entities you expose yourself to foreign currency risk, though it has been shown that over the very long term the price movements of foreign stocks are not perfectly correlated with price movements of US stocks and so adding a little foreign stock can actually reduce risk without compromising return.\n\nIf you take a look at some total world market funds you\'ll see what the big investing houses advocate. Fidelity\'s multi-asset index fund has about 40% of its equity position allocated to foreign stock. Vanguard\'s allocation in their total world market index is similar. But you\'ll have to determine for yourself what\'s right for you. I\'ve placed a link below to a pretty useful tool called ""Portfolio Visualizer"". You can play around with different allocations and see how they have impacted performance and volatility over time. \n\n[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation)\n\nA couple of caveats I\'d offer before you consider foreign stock. The first is that if you have investments in both tax sheltered and non-sheltered accounts it\'s generally most efficient to hold foreign stocks in taxable. The reason is that most countries withhold tax on dividend distributions. The US offers a foreign tax credit to offset the tax you pay, but you can\'t take advantage of that tax credit in a 401k or IRA account. The second caveat has to do with psychology. When you hold something that is not the S&P500 you\'ll see that your performance will be different from the S&P500. Sometimes this will be a good thing. Sometimes it won\'t. If you think you\'re the type of person who will get frustrated and abandon an allocation to foreign stock after a period of disappointment then you might want to stick with a plain vanilla US stock fund. Changing allocations after disappointment is the easiest way to guarantee you\'re buying high and selling low. Not exactly a formula for success.\n\nLast thing.... when it comes to diversification I don\'t think the S&P500 is all it\'s cracked up to be. After all, 25% of the S&P500 is allocated to just six companies! Maybe that will be a problem. Maybe not. Only the future knows.', 'Gotta second the comment advocating for doing your own research.  It\'s a pretty divisive topic.   If you go to the Bogleheads forum, you\'ll see that this is one of the most commonly discussed topics, and there is pretty bitter disagreement (the reddit Bogleheads forum tends to side with international diversification, though).\n\nIf you do diversify internationally, you need to consider which countries to include.   Some funds track only developed markets (Europe, Japan, Australia, etc).   Some funds track only emerging markets (China, India, South American countries, etc).   And some funds track it all (Developed and emerging).\n\nDeveloped markets are considered lower risk, emerging markets are considered higher risk.   Theoretically (and I believe long term historical returns show this to be the case), emerging markets should command a higher risk premium (better returns) relative to developed markets.   But emerging markets are way more volatile.\n\nThings to consider:\n\nThere are many time periods where international markets out perform the US.   The US has had ""lost decades"" of flat to negative returns (see 2000-2010), and during those periods, international is tending to do better.\n\nInternational stocks have lower valuations relative to the US, so theoretically, one could expect international to outperform relative to US stocks which are already bid up very high with outsized expectations of performance.  (Generally, different countries/sectors/cap-sizes take turns outperforming/underperforming each other... the winners of the recent past can generally be expected to underperform going forward).\n\nAt certain (lowish) allocations, portfolios with international can be expected to outperform a single country portfolio (including the US) WITH LESS RISK.  I think we are talking about the 80/20 zone, roughly (US/int).   \n\nDownsides people mention: various risk factors; currency risk, political risk, economies less favorable to companies and investors (too many regulations, too many worker protections, etc).\n\nUS/international markets are more correlated than ever, thus reducing diversification benefit compared to the past.   Major US corporations get significant sources of their income from abroad, so some folks argue that owning the S&P already gives you international exposure.   \n\nAnd, over the last 10-15 years, international has MASSIVELY lagged behind the US stock market.  (Counterpoint; much of the US stock growth is just valuation expansion... not actual economic outperformance).  \n\nThis is just a really difficult topic.   Most major investment houses (Fidelity, Vanguard, etc) will encourage you to diversify internationally, though, and many of them project that international will likely outperform in the coming decade.   Trouble is, people have been predicting that for awhile now, and it still hasn\'t happened.   So maybe it\'s just that much more likely to happen soon.... or maybe it won\'t happen.\n\nI personally see international exposure as a hedge against US underperformance, and I allocate around 15-20 percent of my equity index purchases to international.   (80 to 85% in the S&P, 15-20% to TOTAL international).   Market cap weighting would be more like 60/40 US/int (this is the relative value of the US market compared to the rest of the world).\n\nDo some reading and figure out what makes sense to you!   You kind of opened a can of worms.   It was simpler when all you had to do was throw money into one thing!\n\nYou can always start small and gradually up your allocation to international if you want to.', 'Thank you this is incredibly helpful!', 'I keep a small percent in qqq', ""I lean heavily SP500 but also carry IXUS to diversify.

Is it worth selling my wash sale and incurring the losses if I don't rebuy the stock within the 30 days this year, or am I able to accrue the loss next year, assuming I don't rebuy that stock within the 30 day window so that I can have that wash sale on my tax return ? If I sell my wash sale this year and don't rebuy it within 30 days I would be able to add that loss to my taxes for 2023 but I don't have any major gains so would it make more sense to put that loss on next years tax return and sell my wash sale in 2024, assuming I have more gains for 2024 ?",Company Question,[],[],stocks
